Wireless IR Remote connection
PB2 on Uniko Dvi in the input for the IR Remote - TSOP is connected
Page31 from Level 4 book - Infrared Wireles Remote HEX codes and keys
Since TSOP has 16 bits of address and 16 bits of Data, total 32 bits are recieved
besides 32 bits of address and data, Uniko Dvi also recieves 'start of signal' (2 bits)
and 'end of signal' (1 bit) which has to be discarded while displaying the values on the serial monitor
This we do by initialising bit_position = -2, and this will only read 32 bits of address and data.
When TSOP does not recieve data, PB2 will be high, and when TSOP receives data, PB2 pin will be LOW.
